                If you choose, or you are provided with, a user identification code,
                password or any other piece of information as part of our security
                procedures, you must treat such information as confidential.
                It is your responsibility to have secure access to the internet and we
                recommend that you change your passwords regularly via our website
                to keep your details as secure as possible. In addition we strongly
                suggest that you do not use the same password for any other online
                accounts you hold.
                You must not disclose your username, passwords, or other secure
                information to any other party. Where we believe the integrity of our
                systems could be compromised by you providing your username and

                Where such disclosure leads to your account being blocked we will
                not be liable for any losses that could arise. We are entitled to treat

                complied with these terms and conditions or failure to take reasonable
                security precautions.

                see all the same information as you would if you were logging into the
                account. For security reasons, you should not provide your password or

                have linked your account to. We will not be responsible for deals placed
                on your account by a third party, even if those instructions conflict with

            <h4>
                We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another
                organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will
                ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.
                You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms
                to another person if we agree in writing.
                These terms do not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of
                Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this agreement.
                Each section of these terms operates separately. If any court or
                relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining
                paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
                No delay, act or omission by us or you in enforcing these terms will
                prevent us or you from enforcing these terms at a later stage.

                These terms of use, their subject matter and their formation, are
                governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of
                England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction except that if you
                are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in
                Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of Scotland you may also bring
                proceedings in Scotland.
